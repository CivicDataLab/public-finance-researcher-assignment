### **Objective**

Exploratory analysis of the data to unsterstand the composition and trends of the budget expenditure and district spending data.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(formattable)
library(lubridate)
```

### **Read**

Read the combined and cleaned state expenditure and district spending datasets for exploratory analysis.

```{r read, cache = TRUE}
# State expenditure data
budget_exp_final <- read_csv("../data/processed/budget_exp_final.csv")

# Distirct spending data
district_spending_exp_final <- read_csv("../data/processed/district_spending_exp_final.csv")
```

### **Analysis**

#### **State Budget Expenditure**

##### **Overall**

```{r overall}
# Quick Summary
budget_exp_final %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarise(sanction = sum(sanction),
              addition = sum(addition),
              savings = sum(savings),
              revised = sum(revised))
```

* The sanctioned budget amount for Himachal Pradesh in 2018-19 was 159.7 Cr., a 14.5% increase over the previous years budget. 
* Post revisions, the allocated amount went down to 97.2% of the sanctions allocated in the year 2017-18, and 95% in the year 2018-19.

##### **Top Major Account Heads**

```{r account-heads}
# Account Head Wise spending
budget_exp_final %>%
    group_by(year, demand_desc) %>%
    summarise(sanction = sum(sanction)) %>%
    spread(year, sanction, fill = 0) %>%
    arrange(desc(`2018-19`)) %>%
    mutate(`Total Sanction (2018-19)` = sum(`2018-19`),
           `Total Sanction (2017-18)` = sum(`2017-18`)) %>%
    mutate(`% of Expenditure (2018-19)` = percent(`2018-19`/`Total Sanction (2018-19)`),
           `% of Expenditure (2017-18)` = percent(`2017-18`/`Total Sanction (2017-18)`)) %>%
    select(demand_desc, `2018-19`, `% of Expenditure (2018-19)`, `2017-18`, `% of Expenditure (2017-18)`)
```

* Finance was alloyed the highest amount of all account heads, 30.49% of total sanctioned expenditure for the year; followed by Education with 14.12% & Public Works â€“ Roads Bridges & Buildings at 10.26%
* This trend has followed form 2017-18 in terms of priority for the state budget allocations.

##### **Allocations Over Time**

```{r over-time}
# Trends for budget allocation over time
budget_exp_final %>%
    mutate(month = floor_date(transaction_date, unit = "month")) %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise(sanction = sum(sanction),
              revised = sum(revised)) %>%
    gather(type, amount, -month) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = amount, color = type)) +
    geom_line() + geom_point()
```

* Looking at the time trends data, the impression recieved is that budgets and revisions are done with the intent to distribute the aloocations at a dataily basis on the projected price.
* It will be interesting to compare it against the spending data to see the spending trends on ground.

##### **Voted/Charged & Plan/Non-Plan**

```{r voted-charged-plan, warning = FALSE}
# Voted/Charged
budget_exp_final %>%
    group_by(year, voted_charged) %>%
    summarise(sanction = sum(sanction)) %>%
    spread(voted_charged, sanction) %>%
    mutate(percent_charged = percent(C/(V+C)),
           percent_voted = percent(V/(V+C)))

# Plan/Non-Plan
budget_exp_final %>%
    group_by(year, plan_nonplan) %>%
    summarise(sanction = sum(sanction)) %>%
    spread(plan_nonplan, sanction) %>%
    mutate(percent_non_plan = percent(N/(N+P)),
           percent_plan = percent(P/(N+P)))
```

* ~83% of all budgetary allocation in Himachal Pradesh in Voted, remaining ~17% charged.
* ~78% of all budgetary allocation is non-plan expense, and remaning ~22% planned.

##### **2018-19 vs 2017-18**
